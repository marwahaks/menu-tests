Just a sample project in which I CRUD on an existing menu.

I have created test which test the CRUD functionality.

The test framework is Specflow with NUnit. Thee test in question to add items to the basket is called `Order Menu Items`

After each run test run the menu is reverted back to a known state.

For this project I have created the Menu an XML document just for the MVP.

I have used VS 2019 - so I hope that doesn't cause any issue if you're using a previous version of VS.


Any questions please don hesitate to ask.
